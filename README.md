nuk

nuk is a generic turn based game server written in Erlang. It provides common functionality useful for turn based game servers. Game developers need only implement the game itself.

Features
--------

- write and plug in your own game using behavior callbacks
- implement or plug in your own user and session storage

what nuk is *not*:
